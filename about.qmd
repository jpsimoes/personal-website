title: "About"
---

I'm an Assistant Professor in Health Psychology, AI and Technology at the University of Twente (NL). I also work part-time at Roessingh, a rehabilitation clinic in Enschede where I design and evaluate technology-based interventions for chronic pain management. On my free time, I like playing with my kids üßíüëßüë∂, going to the lake üé£, and catching movies üçø.

## Background

I studied Psychology and Neurosciences for my Bachelor's (BR) and Master's (NL). Then I did my PhD and postdoc in Germany, investigating ways to use mobile health, machine learning, and crowdsourcing to better understand tinnitus heterogeneity and improve patient care.

## Research Interests

I work on interventions for people dealing with chronic conditions like tinnitus, pain, depression, and anxiety. The goal is to make treatments that actually scale and meet people where they are. I mix therapeutic approaches (ACT, CBT, behavior change techniques) with digital tools like wearable sensors and smartphone tracking to see what's happening in people's daily lives, not just in the lab. All of this gets tested through experimental designs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. What I'm really after is helping people build resilience and improve their quality of life, while also figuring out the details: what works, for whom, and why.
