# Quarto personal site (Simon P. Couch–style clone)

This is a Quarto website scaffold that mimics the structure and feel of https://www.simonpcouch.com (with placeholders).

## Structure
- `_quarto.yml` — site config (title, navbar, footer, theme)
- `index.qmd` — home with hero image and tagline
- `about.qmd` — about page
- `software.qmd` — software/packages page
- `blog.qmd` — blog listing page with RSS
- `posts/` — example posts
- `styles.scss` — light custom styling
- `img/portrait.png` — placeholder avatar (replace)

## Usage
1. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org).
2. In this folder, run:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```
3. Edit files and redeploy as needed (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).
