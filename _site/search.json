    "text": "Research Interests\nI work on interventions for people dealing with chronic conditions like tinnitus, pain, depression, and anxiety. The goal is to make treatments that actually scale and meet people where they are. I mix therapeutic approaches (ACT, CBT, behavior change techniques) with digital tools like wearable sensors and smartphone tracking to see what’s happening in people’s daily lives, not just in the lab. All of this gets tested through experimental designs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. What I’m really after is helping people build resilience and improve their quality of life, while also figuring out the details: what works, for whom, and why."
